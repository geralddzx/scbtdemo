# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# User.create({
# 		first_name: "gerald",
# 		last_name: "ding",
# 		email: "geralddzx@gmail.com",
# 		role: "master",
# 		username: "gding",
# 		password: "turtle",
# 		password_confirmation: "turtle",
# 	})

# News.create({
